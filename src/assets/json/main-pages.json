As the repository for technologies, artifacts, and knowledge deemed too dangerous for public awareness or even storage elsewhere, Memory Theta embodies the ancient legacy inherent to its name. Due to its highly classified contents and location, the facility and its staff have been given a quasi-mythical status among even the highest echelons of Starfleet.<\/p><br><p>Previous administrators have resigned from the post due to workplace stress and psychological strain. Retrieval missions are not for the faint of heart, having garnered an unofficial reputation of terror in the Starfleet grapevine. Whenever a Theta team shows up, it often means some type of horror is on the horizon.</p><br><p>Pay no mind to the domesticated Borg drone butlers.</p> <br> <p>Peruse the Memory Theta Archives if you dare, or contact us with an entry of your own--please use this <a href=\"#\">template</a></p><br><p> Feel free to join us on <a href=\"https://discord.gg/gWYZsUJ\">Discord</a>!</p><br><p><strong><a href=\"https://rpgrating.com\"><img src=\"https://rpgrating.com/ratings/323.png\" alt=\"3-2-3\"> This simulation is rated 16+</a></strong></p>"
