In commemoration of half a decade of awesome roleplay, I am pleased to initiate a special interlude that will send the Memory Theta team to Risa for a much-needed vacation. Of course, nothing ever seems to go according to plan, but that's always been half the fun. Thank you, one and all, for joining me on this journey of discovery and exploration into a side of Star Trek that had yet to be explored at the time of our beginning. I daresay that our not-so-humble sim has made an indelible mark on the simming community and perhaps sent waves clear up to the writing rooms of modern Trek production (I'm looking at you, Lower Decks!). <br><br> Kick back, run wild on Risa, and pat yourselves on the back for five years of greatness. Here's to five more! <br><br> <img src=\"https://media.tenor.com/u_R_zH2ozxoAAAAC/kowalski-read-this.gif\">"

From deep character development to intricate plot devices to taking the unexpected turn, this crew always keeps things interesting. Their commitment to excellence has been recognized many times over, most recently by taking home top prize at the Tournament of Simulations.\"</em><br><br> Truth be told, I had never heard of this particular award before, but it appears we were nominated multiple times last year since the explanation given includes our top place in last year's Tournament of Sims. I have no idea who nominated because I had no idea we were nominated. Congratulations on becoming internet famous!"
